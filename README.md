# Silent Failures in Dart Async/Await: Ignoring Exceptions

This example demonstrates a common error in Dart asynchronous operations: neglecting to handle exceptions properly within `catch` blocks.  Ignoring exceptions can lead to silent failures, making debugging challenging. The application might appear to function normally but fail to update the UI or perform crucial tasks.

The `bug.dart` file showcases this issue. The `fetchData` function uses `async`/`await` to fetch data from a remote API. While it includes a `try-catch` block, the `catch` block simply prints the error and continues.  This is problematic because it doesn't inform the user of the failure, potentially leading to unexpected behavior. 

The `bugSolution.dart` file presents a more robust solution that addresses these issues by handling errors and providing better feedback to the user.
